# Quantum Computing -based Optimization for Sustainable Data Workflows in Cloud

## This will be updated after the presentation and code are ready!

We built the presentation with reveal.js which is an open source HTML presentation framework. It enables anyone with a web browser to create fully featured and beautiful presentations for free. [Check out the live demo](https://revealjs.com/). The full reveal.js documentation is available at [revealjs.com](https://revealjs.com).

In order to run the presentation, you need to add the sufficient source files to the same folder with index.html. The source files are the files included in the latest reveal.js version, [see the installation](https://revealjs.com/installation/#basic-setup).
