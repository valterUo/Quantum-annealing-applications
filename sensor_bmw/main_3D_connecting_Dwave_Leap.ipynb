    "Unfortunately, it seems that Amazon Bracket does not yet support D-waves hybrid solvers. We might be wrong but we could not figure out how to access, for example, LeapHybridSampler using Bracket. It seems that BracketDWaveSampler and BracketSampler are using the standard DWaveSampler (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/system/en/stable/reference/samplers.html). Because our solution is based on LeapHybridSampler, it is not possible to run it in Bracket. Maybe in the future Amazon will implement something like BracketDWaveHybridSampler which offers the functionality of LeapHybridSampler. Anyway, we are positively impressed how Bracket collects various quantum computing resources together."
